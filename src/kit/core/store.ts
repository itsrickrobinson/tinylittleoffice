/**
 * The one place the site keeps anything on the device. Private by default: settings live in memory for the
 * visit and nothing is written. Asked to keep things (the switch in the menu), it writes to localStorage
 * instead, and the preferences and what comes later follow. Private
 * again, every trace goes. The one key written in either state is the choice itself, and only when it is
 * "keep": a private visit writes nothing about a document, but the size of everything (kit/ui/zoom.ts) and the theme
 * (kit/ui/theme.ts) stay through Private and Saved alike: they say nothing of a document, and a link opened from a
 * message at the wrong size is a wall to a person who reads at 200% (the review of 2026-10-11). Forget everything
 * forgets them with the rest. The language is never written here: the link carries it (kit/core/route.ts, kit/core/i18n.ts).
